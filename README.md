## DuPont Analysis
DuPont analysis is a powerful tool used to dissect a company's return on equity (ROE) into its underlying components, namely profitability, efficiency, and leverage. Here's how we can perform DuPont analysis for TVS Motor Company based on the provided financial data:
- ROE = (PAT/PBT).(PBT/PBIT).(PBIT/SALES).(SALES/TOTAL ASSETS).(TOTAL ASSETS/NET WORTH)
- (PAT/PBT) = Tax Burden
- (PBT/PBIT) = Interest Burden
- (PBIT/Sales) = Operating Profit Margin
- (Sales/Total Assets) = Total Asset Turnover Ratio
- (Total Assets/Net Worth) = Leverage Ratio

## Conclusion
Based on the investigation, it seems like Patanjali Foods can enhance its operational efficiency and sustain profitability. On the other hand, issues with asset utilisation, a growing dependence on debt financing, and diminishing returns for shareholders point to areas that require more focus. If Patanjali Foods wants to maintain long-term growth and profitability in the cutthroat automotive sector, it may need to concentrate on improving asset management, reducing debt, and putting plans in place to increase shareholder value.
